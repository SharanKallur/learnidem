States are yaml file definitions with extension <b>SLS</b> <br>
States can be accessed by their relative location in idem-azure-auto/idem_azure_auto/states.<br>
For example, in the <b>State SLS</b> yaml file below, Azure resource group state can be created and subsequently updated with the [Present](/Getting-Started/Basic-Commands/) state function. 

The following examples showcase how to use the available [idem states](/Getting-Started/Basic-Commands/) to work with Azure Resources.
Make sure to export the encryption key and path to the <i>fernet file</i> as an environment variable as described in the [authentication section](/Getting-Started/Authenticate/) before trying the commands below
