Cloud Plug-Ins expand [Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) capabilities and allow you to interface with a variety of technologies and endpoints.<br><br>
With [Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) , the term “Cloud” does not just mean cloud Plug-Ins like AWS, Azure, and GCP, it means all things SaaS.<br>
[Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) can describe and enforce sites like GitLab.com. Anything and everything that has an API is fair game for Idem.
<br><br>
The Python Package Installer [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) tool is used for installing / updating and uninstalling Cloud Plug-Ins.
