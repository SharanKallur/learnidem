Welcome to "Getting Started" with Idem. Idem is an idempotent dataflow programming language. It exposes stateful programming constructs that makes things like enforcing the state of your cloud resources, an application, configuration, or anything really....very simple.

Idem is super simple to learn and even easier to get started. In this section we are going to guide you through the steps to get you managing you cloud environments. It's an easy three step process:

### 1. [Install Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem)
idem can work on any operating system. It's available from [source](https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/idem) or through a package manager. (Make it easy on yourself..use the package manager route)

### 2. [Select a Cloud Provider](/Getting-Started/Cloud-Providers)
Now it's time to pick a could to manage. These examples will focus in on AWS and Azure but other clouds are available by checking out the [Idem Docs](https://idemproject.io/docs). Add one and let's get going!!

### 3. [Authenticating with Idem](/Getting-Started/Authenticate)
It's super easy to manage multiple clouds and authenticate to then with Idem. You can even have multiple credentials for the same cloud and switch between them. It's just easy.

### [Understanding Idem Basic Commands](/Getting-Started/Basic-Commands)
There are some basic commands that are used often with Idem. In this section you will get to know these commands before tackling your first cloud.

Idem is based on the concept of [Plugin Oriented Programming](https://pop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
