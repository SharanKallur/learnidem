Welcome to Learn Idem! This site is designed as a living technical reference focussed on providing in-depth information for the Idem developer - whether you’re new to Idem or an experienced Idem developer.

The Getting Started section will provide some basic tutorials to help you on your way to learning Idem.

Learn Idem is written primarily by the Technical Marketing team for vRealize Automation, but we’d love for you to contribute! There’s an “Edit on GitHub” link on each page that will take you to the source code for that content - feel free to fork the repository and write your own - we look forward to your Pull Requests!

# What is Idem?

Using a cloud should not require you to write massive amounts of code

Idem reduces your cloud configuration to data – for you! Instead of Infrastructure as Code, Idem delivers Infrastructure as Data. The cloud becomes simplified, easier to maintain, easier to discover, and easier to use.
Be liberated from writing and maintaining that mountain of code!

<b><h3>Describe</h3></b>
Idem can scan your current cloud deployments and generate all of the data needed to enforce it. The ultimate introspection into your cloud is just seconds away! Better yet, the generated data is easier to read than code, and easy to modify! You can also regenerate it at any time. The source of truth for your cloud automation is your cloud.

<b><h3>Enforce</h3></b>
Take the data in your cloud description and use idem to enforce it. Sending the cloud data back into Idem allows you to use Idem’s powerful idempotent, declarative, concurrent automation engine to create, manage, port, and automate your cloud at breakneck speeds!

<b><h3>Beyond the Cloud</h3></b>
With Idem, the term “Cloud” does not just mean cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, it means all things SaaS. Idem can describe and enforce sites like GitLab.com. Anything and everything that has an API is fair game for Idem.

<b><h3>This is Just the Beginning</h3></b>
Idem is an open source, Apache Licensed project from the minds of VMware’s top engineers. The goals of Idem are significant. We are seeking to create a universal cloud automation engine that can be leveraged to drive new ways to automate far more than just cloud infrastructure. We have come together with next generation concepts to allow us to keep up with cloud and API changes faster than anything developed in the past. By taking the burden of
